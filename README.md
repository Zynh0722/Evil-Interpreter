# Evil-Interpreter
This is a simple javascript based visual interpreter, It's likely very buggy in its current state, Submitting issues helps alot!

## Current Functionality
* 25 of evil's 26 commands
  * q is the excluded command
* a live view of all pent, wheel, and accumulator values
* a functionally source code input
* a slider to change the run rate

## Current known issues
* q doesn't exist
* no way to change the input without changing the sketch.js file directly
* it's made by me :/

## Issue Priority 
1. Adding a way to change input from within the canvas
1. make q a thing
